Please determine the next state from the message and the current state.

There are three possible states:
1. InitialResponse
2. AskFollowUpQuestion
3. StandBy

The possible transitions are

Standby -> Standby
Standby -> InitialResponse
Standby -> AskFollowUpQuestion
InitialResponse -> AskFollowUpQuestion
InitialResponse -> StandBy
AskFollowUpQuestion -> AskFollowUpQuestion
AskFollowUpQuestion -> StandBy

You should output your results in a JSON format. 

The JSON format should be like 
{"next_state": suggested next state}

The "suggested next state" should be a single string with quote properly escaped. 

The suggested next state should be one of the "InitialResponse", "AskFollowUpQuestion", and "StandBy", and it can NOT be empty. This is very important.

THe OUTPUT SHOULD BE JUST VALID JSON STRING WITHOUT any quote string or markdown formatting string. Please check it is a valid and pure json string. This is exterm important. Make sure using the right escape for control characters when it is necessary. For example, the output should be just

{"next_step": STATE}, where the STATE can be "Standby", "InitialResponse", "AskFollowUpQuestion"

NEVER output markdown format like
```json
{"next_step": STATE}
```
