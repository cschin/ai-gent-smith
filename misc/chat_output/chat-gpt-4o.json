The FDA's guidance on the safety of nanomaterials in cosmetic products outlines considerations for industry when assessing the safety of these materials. Here are the main components:\n\n1. **Current Thinking**: The guidance represents the FDA's current thinking on the safety of nanomaterials in cosmetics. It does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities but provides recommendations.\n\n2. **Alternative Approaches**: The guidance allows for alternative approaches if they satisfy applicable statutes and regulations. Industry representatives are encouraged to discuss alternative approaches with the FDA staff responsible for implementing the guidance.\n\n3. **Assessment of Nanotechnology**: The FDA considers whether a product involves nanotechnology by evaluating if a material or end product is engineered to have at least one dimension in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm) or if it exhibits properties or phenomena attributable to its dimensions, even if these dimensions fall outside the nanoscale range, up to one micrometer (1,000 nm).\n\n4. **Safety Substantiation**: The guidance emphasizes the need for safety substantiation of cosmetic products, whether they contain nanomaterials or are conventionally manufactured. This involves reliance on available toxicological data and performance of additional tests as appropriate.\n\n5. **Product Attributes**: The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from conventionally manufactured products, necessitating particular examination. However, the FDA does not categorically judge all products containing nanomaterials as intrinsically benign or harmful.\n\nThese components provide a framework for evaluating the safety of nanomaterials in cosmetics, ensuring that such products are safe for consumer use.\n\n### References\n\n- Nano-Cosmetics-Guidance-to-OMB-PDF\n\n  - > **Guidance for Industry1**\n\n    **Safety of Nanomaterials in Cosmetic Products**\n\n    This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA’s) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance.\n\n  - > FDA has not established regulatory definitions of “nanotechnology,” “nanomaterial,” “nanoscale,” or other related terms. In June 2014, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled “Considering Whether an FDA-Regulated Product Involves the Application of Nanotechnology” (Ref. 1). As described in that guidance, at this time, when considering whether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology, FDA will ask: (1) whether a material or end product is engineered to have at least one external dimension, or an internal or surface structure, in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm); and (2) whether a material or end product is engineered to exhibit properties or phenomena, including physical or chemical properties or biological effects, that are attributable to its dimension(s), even if these dimensions fall outside the nanoscale range, up to one micrometer (1,000 nm).\n\n  - > The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from those of conventionally-manufactured products, and thus may merit particular examination. However, we do not categorically judge all products containing nanomaterials or otherwise involving application of nanotechnology as intrinsically benign or harmful.\n\n  - > a) reliance on already available toxicological test data on individual ingredients and on product formulations that are similar in composition to the particular cosmetic, and (b) performance of any additional toxicological and other tests that are appropriate in light of such existing data and information.

If a product does not fit into any existing categories, it is advisable to select the most closely matching category and use the \"other\" category if necessary. Additionally, products intended for use in the eye area should be entered into an eye area product category.\n\n2. **Facility Registration Exemptions**: Certain establishments are exempt from registration, such as those that only label, relabel, package, repackage, hold, or distribute products without manufacturing or processing them. It is crucial to determine if your facility falls under any of these exemptions.\n\n3. **Prohibited and Restricted Ingredients**: Ensure compliance with FDA regulations by avoiding prohibited ingredients such as bithional, vinyl chloride, and certain halogenated salicylanilides, among others. Also, be aware of restricted ingredients like mercury compounds and hexachlorophene, and adhere to their specific usage guidelines.\n\nThese practices will help ensure that your facility meets FDA regulatory requirements and avoids common pitfalls in the registration process.\n\n### References\n\n- Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n\n  - > **Q17.

The term \"hypoallergenic\" is often used in the cosmetic industry to suggest that a product is less likely to cause allergic reactions. However, it's important to note that the FDA does not have specific regulations for cosmetics labeled as \"hypoallergenic.\"\n\nThe FDA does not define or regulate the term \"hypoallergenic.\" Cosmetics labeled as such are not required to undergo any specific testing to support this claim. Manufacturers of cosmetics labeled \"hypoallergenic\" are not required to submit substantiation of their claims to the FDA. This means that the term can be used by manufacturers based on their own standards or criteria, which may vary.\n\nThe use of the term \"hypoallergenic\" is primarily a marketing claim, and consumers should be aware that it is not a guarantee of safety or efficacy. It is important for consumers, especially those with known allergies or sensitive skin, to carefully review the ingredient list of cosmetics and consider conducting a patch test before use.\n\n### References\n\n- Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n\n  - > (Similarity: 0.70622, span: 0-576)  \n    > ***Contains Nonbinding Recommendations***  \n    > ***Draft-Not for Implementation***  \n    > **Prohibited Cosmetic Ingredients**  \n    > Bithional  \n    > Vinyl chloride  \n    > Certain halogenated salicylanilides  \n    > Zirconium in aerosol products  \n    > Chloroform  \n    > Methylene chloride  \n    > Chlorofluorocarbon propellants  \n    > Prohibited cattle material  \n    > **CFR Citation**  \n    > 21 CFR 700.11  \n    > 21 CFR 700.14  \n    > 21 CFR 700.15  \n    > 21 CFR 700.16  \n    > 21 CFR 700.18  \n    > 21 CFR 700.19  \n    > 21 CFR 700.23  \n    > 21 CFR 700.27  \n    > **Restricted Cosmetic Ingredients**  \n    > Mercury compounds  \n    > Hexachlorophene  \n    > **CFR Citation**  \n    > 21 CFR 700.13  \n    > 21 CFR 250.250"

      "content": "I think you might be a regulatory consultant. When it comes to labeling products that are both drugs and cosmetics, the FDA provides specific guidance to ensure compliance with both drug and cosmetic regulations. Here are the key considerations:\n\n1. **Intended Use and Claims**: The intended use of the product determines its classification. If a product is intended for cosmetic purposes, such as beautification or appearance alteration, it falls under cosmetic regulations. However, if it is also intended for therapeutic purposes, such as diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, it must comply with drug regulations as well.\n\n2. **Labeling Requirements**: Products that are both drugs and cosmetics must comply with the labeling requirements for both categories. This involves including all necessary information such as directions for use, warnings, and any required drug facts.\n\n3. **Regulatory Compliance**: The FDA does not require premarket approval for cosmetics, but it prohibits the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce. Therefore, manufacturers need to ensure that their labeling is not false or misleading and that it provides all required information.\n\n4. **Examples of Dual-Use Products**: Examples of products that are both drugs and cosmetics include deodorants that are also antiperspirants, moisturizers and makeup with sun-protection claims, and shampoos that treat dandruff.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, it's advisable to refer to the specific FDA regulations and guidance documents related to drug and cosmetic labeling.\n\n### References\n\n- Guidance-for-Industry---Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-Products-and-their-Regulation-by-the-Food-and-Drug-Administration-(PDF)\n  \n  - > It is possible that certain products used in conjunction with CAM practices may be “cosmetics” under the Act. For example, if a CAM practice involves massage with a moisturizer, the moisturizer could be a “cosmetic” to the extent that it is “rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on” the body for beautification or appearance-altering purposes. However, if the moisturizer’s intended use is also for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body, then it may also be subject to regulation as a drug. Other examples of drug/cosmetic combinations are deodorants that are also antiperspirants, moisturizers and makeup marketed with sun-protection claims, and shampoos that also treat dandruff. The Act does not require premarket approval for cosmetics, but it does prohibit the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce.\n"
