If you manufacture cosmetics, you can reduce the risk of adulterating or misbranding cosmetics by following the GMP recommendations in this guidance. By following these recommendations, you can effectively conduct a self-inspection to rate your operations. Tampering and other malicious, criminal, or terrorist activity present additional risks that can also have a direct impact on your products' quality. To help minimize these risks to cosmetics under your control, we recommend that you consult a separate FDA guidance document entitled\n\"Guidance for Industry: Cosmetic Processors and Transporters of Cosmetics Security Preventive Measures Guidance.\"\nDocumentation: 1) The supplying of documents or supporting references; use of documentary evidence; 2) the documents or references thus supplied; 3) the collecting, abstracting, and coding of printed or written information for future reference. (\"documentation,\" Webster's New World Dictionary Third College Edition, 1988 ed.).\nGood manufacturing practice (GMP): That part of quality assurance aimed at ensuring that products are consistently manufactured to a quality appropriate to their intended use. It is thus concerned with both manufacturing and quality control procedures. (Sharp, John, Good Manufacturing Practice, Philosophy and Applications, Buffalo Grove, IL: Interpharm Press, 1991, pg. 47.). Internal Audit: Systematic and independent examination made by competent personnel inside the company, the aim of which is to determine whether activities covered by these guidelines and related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable for achieving objectives.

Nonetheless, companies and individuals who manufacture or market cosmetics are legally responsible for ensuring the safety of their products.\n\n- **Voluntary Testing by Companies**: In terms of product testing, companies may conduct or rely on various tests to substantiate the safety of a product. This could include toxicological testing, patch testing for skin irritation, or other scientifically valid tests that assess the safety of the cosmetic products for human use.\n\n- **Regulatory Compliance and Consumer Safety**: The FDA can enforce actions against products marketed in interstate commerce that fail to comply with the law, for example, if a product is adulterated or misbranded. Companies are encouraged to conduct, assess, and document safety testing to support the safety and labeling of cosmetic products.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Under the **FD&C Act**, cosmetic manufacturers are not required to gain pre-market approval for their products, except for color additives.

Cosmetics must be safe for consumers under labeled or customary conditions of use.\n\n2. **Product Safety**: Although the FDA does not require pre-market approval for cosmetics, you are responsible for ensuring that your cosmetics are safe. Conduct necessary scientific tests, such as toxicological evaluations or patch tests, to substantiate product safety.\n\n3. **Labeling Requirements**: Make sure your products are properly labeled. Cosmetic labels must comply with the labeling requirements outlined in the FD&C Act, including listing product ingredients in a standard way.\n\n4. **Product Registration and Listing**: While voluntary, you can register your cosmetic products with the FDA. Product listing allows the FDA to keep informed about what cosmetics are available in the marketplace. The registration and listing process is streamlined with the same electronic submission process used for drug establishments.\n\n5. **Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)**: Adhere to cosmetic GMP guidelines to ensure product quality and safety in your manufacturing process. Although GMP guidelines for cosmetics are not mandatory, they are highly recommended.\n\nBy adhering to these initial steps, you will establish a compliant foundation for your cosmetic business. Here are some pertinent references from FDA documentation:\n\n### References:\n- **Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24**\n  - \"FDA requests that individuals submitting registration and listing information to attest to the accuracy and veracity of the information submitted.\"\n  - \"There is no fee to submit a registration or product listing to FDA under section 607 of the FD&C Act.\"\n\nIf you have further questions about specific aspects of FDA cosmetic guidelines or need more detailed assistance, feel free to ask!"

This process is also used for drug establishments, which helps streamline submissions if you handle both types of products.\n\n2. **No Registration Fee**: It's important to note that the FDA does not charge a fee to submit a registration or product listing under section 607 of the FD&C Act.\n\n3. **Submit Accurate Information**: Ensure that all submitted information, including the facility's DUNS number, contact details, and product listing information, is accurate and verifiable. FDA requests an attestation to the accuracy of all information submitted.\n\n4. **Product Categories and Ingredients**: When registering products, use the applicable product category or categories and list all ingredients, including fragrances, flavors, or colors. Ingredients should be identified by their name as required under section 701.3 of Title 21, CFR, or by common names.\n\n5. **Keep Registrations Updated**: Registrations and product listings need to be maintained and updated as necessary. This includes annual updates, and any changes to content must be submitted through an update or abbreviated renewal process as described in section 607(c)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\n6. **Optional Information**: While not mandatory, submitting additional information such as images of product labels, links to product webpages, whether the product is for professional use only, and Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNIIs) can be beneficial for comprehensive records.\n\n### References:\n- **Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24**\n\n   - \"A facility that manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are also drugs is not subject to the registration requirement under section 607 unless it also manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are not also drugs.

Here are some common mistakes that can lead to non-compliance:\n\n1. **Failing to Register Facilities**: Not registering your cosmetic manufacturing facility with the FDA can be a common mistake. It's crucial to use the FDAâ€™s electronic submission process for facility registration and product listing.\n\n2. **Incorrect Product Labeling**: Labels must include the proper name and identity of the product as per section 701.11, along with accurate ingredient lists in line with section 701.3 of title 21 in the Code of Federal Regulations. Mislabeling can lead to compliance issues.\n\n3. **Unlisted Ingredients**: Not listing all ingredients as per FDA requirements can result in non-compliance. Each ingredient must be identified with the correct name or its common or usual name.\n\n4. **Ignoring Updates**: Failing to update registrations annually or when changes occur can lead to non-compliance. Regular updates ensure that the FDA has the most current information about your products and facilities.\n\n5. **Lack of Transparency**: Not providing optional, yet helpful, details like product label images or web links may not lead directly to non-compliance, but it can limit effective communication and transparency with the FDA.\n\n6. **Overlooking Product Categories**: Not correctly identifying and listing product categories may lead to errors in product registration and potential violations.\n\n7. **Inadequate Reporting Mechanisms**: Insufficient reporting mechanisms for adverse events can be problematic. The label should have contact information for reporting, which can include a domestic address, phone number, or an electronic contact method.\n\nBy avoiding these common pitfalls and adhering to FDA guidelines, you can ensure compliance and build a responsible cosmetic business.\n\n### References:\n\n1. **Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24**: \n   - \"the name and contact number of the responsible person and the name for the cosmetic product, as such name appears on the label; the applicable cosmetic category or categories for the cosmetic product (refer to Appendix A below); a list of ingredients in the cosmetic product, including any fragrances, flavors, or colors, with each ingredient identified by the name, as required under section 701.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), or by the common or usual name of the ingredient;\"\n   \n2. **Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24**:\n   - \"Under section 607(c)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, a single listing submission for a cosmetic product may include multiple cosmetic products with identical formulations, or formulations that differ only with respect to colors, fragrances or flavors, or quantity of contents.\"\n\n3. **Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24**:\n   - \"We recommend that firms consider when selecting electronic contact information, such as an email address or a website (whether foreign or domestic), how they can best facilitate reporting and responding to these reports, and meeting maintenance, inspection, and reporting requirements under section 605 of the FD&C Act.\"\n\nIf you have further questions or need more information, feel free to ask!"
