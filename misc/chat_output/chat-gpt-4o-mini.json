Introduction**  \n  This document provides guidance to industry and other stakeholders (e.g., consumer interest groups, academia, other regulatory groups) on FDA’s current thinking concerning what constitutes Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for cosmetics. It is intended to assist industry and other stakeholders in identifying the standards and issues that can affect the quality of cosmetic products. This guidance revises the “Cosmetic Good Manufacturing (GMP) Guidelines/Inspection Checklist” by updating it to set forth current practice, and clarify certain topic areas based on recent experience. In addition, as part of an international harmonization effort with the International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulations (ICCR), FDA (or we) agreed to consider the current International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for cosmetic GMPs (ISO 22716:2007) when revising this guidance. We reviewed ISO 22716 and decided to incorporate, modify, or exclude specific aspects of it into this guidance based on our experience. FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word *should* in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required."

Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Complaint Management**: Manufacturers should have a system in place to receive, evaluate, and respond to consumer complaints. This includes documenting the nature of the complaint and any actions taken in response.\n\n2. **Adverse Events Reporting**: While cosmetics are not subject to the same reporting requirements as drugs, the FDA encourages companies to voluntarily report serious adverse events associated with their products. This includes any unexpected or serious side effects that consumers experience.\n\n3. **Recall Procedures**: If a cosmetic product is found to be unsafe or noncompliant with regulations, the manufacturer should initiate a recall. The FDA recommends that companies have a recall plan that outlines the steps to be taken, including notifying retailers and consumers, and ensuring the safe disposal of the recalled products.\n\n4. **Communication with FDA**: Manufacturers are advised to communicate with the FDA regarding any significant safety issues, recalls, or adverse events to ensure proper oversight and consumer safety.\n\nThese steps are crucial for maintaining product safety and consumer trust in cosmetic products.\n\n### References\n\n- Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n     \n     - > \"Under section 607(c)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, a single listing submission for a cosmetic product may include multiple cosmetic products with identical formulations, or formulations that differ only with respect to colors, fragrances or flavors, or quantity of contents.\"\n     \n     - > \"FDA also requests that the following additional optional information be submitted: parent company name (if applicable); product webpage link; whether the cosmetic product is for professional use only; Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNIIs) and type of business (as listed on the label), i.e., manufacturer, packer, or distributor; image of the label; responsible person DUNS Number for address listed on product label.\"\n     \n     - > \"The responsible person will need to obtain the relevant facility registration number(s) for each facility where its cosmetic products are manufactured or processed, because the facility registration number(s) is required for the product listing submission.\" \n\n- Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n     \n     - > \"***Contains Nonbinding Recommendations***\" \n\n- Preparation-and-Public-Availability--of-Information-Given-to-Advisory-Committee-Members\n     \n     - > \"New drug applications and application supplements; New animal drug applications and application supplements; Biologics license applications and application supplements; Premarket approval applications for medical devices and their supplements; Premarket notifications for medical devices; and Medical device classifications and reclassifications.\""

Here are some potential developments in cosmetic products that may emerge:\n\n1. **Personalized Cosmetics**: Advances in genomics and biotechnology could lead to highly personalized cosmetic formulations tailored to an individual's genetic makeup, skin type, and environmental factors. This could include custom skincare regimens that adapt to changes in a person's skin condition over time.\n\n2. **Smart Cosmetics**: The integration of smart technology into cosmetic products may allow for real-time monitoring of skin health and environmental conditions. Products could change their formulation or delivery mechanism based on the user's skin's needs, such as hydration levels or UV exposure.\n\n3. **Biodegradable and Eco-Friendly Formulations**: With increasing awareness of environmental issues, future cosmetics are likely to prioritize sustainability. This could include the use of biodegradable ingredients, packaging made from renewable resources, and formulations that minimize water usage.\n\n4. **Advanced Anti-Aging Solutions**: Innovations in biotechnology may lead to the development of more effective anti-aging products that not only address the signs of aging but also promote cellular regeneration and skin repair.\n\n5. **Augmented Reality (AR) Applications**: AR technology could enhance the consumer experience by allowing users to visualize how products will look on them before application. This could extend to virtual try-ons for makeup and skincare products.\n\n6. **Health-Integrated Cosmetics**: Future cosmetics may incorporate health benefits, such as formulations that provide SPF protection, antioxidants, or even medicinal properties that promote skin health and overall well-being.\n\n7. **Regenerative and Healing Products**: Advances in regenerative medicine might lead to cosmetics that not only enhance appearance but also aid in skin healing and regeneration, potentially using stem cells or bioengineered tissues.\n\n8. **Customized Nutraceuticals**: The future might see the rise of nutraceuticals—products that combine nutrition and pharmaceuticals—designed to improve skin health from within, potentially including supplements that enhance the efficacy of topical products.\n\nThese predictions are speculative but reflect ongoing trends in science and technology that could shape the future of the cosmetics industry.\n\n### References\n\n- Document title: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n  - > ***Contains Nonbinding Recommendations***\n  \n- Document title: Guidance-for-Indiustry--Cosmetic-Good-Manufacturing-Practices-PDF\n  - > ***Contains Nonbinding Recommendations***"

      "content": "Hypoallergenic cosmetics are products formulated to minimize the risk of allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. The term \"hypoallergenic\" suggests that these cosmetics contain fewer allergens and irritants compared to regular cosmetic products. However, it is important to note that there is no regulatory definition of \"hypoallergenic\" recognized by the FDA, meaning that manufacturers can use the term without standardized testing or criteria.\n\nThe formulation of hypoallergenic cosmetics typically involves the selection of ingredients that are less likely to provoke allergic responses. Common practices may include avoiding known allergens, such as certain fragrances, dyes, and preservatives. Despite this, it is still possible for individuals to have allergic reactions to hypoallergenic products, as individual sensitivities can vary widely.\n\nIn the context of cosmetic safety and efficacy, it is advisable for consumers with known allergies or sensitive skin to conduct patch tests before using new products, regardless of labeling claims.\n\n### References\n\n- Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n  - > ***Contains Nonbinding Recommendations***<br> \n  - > **Prohibited Cosmetic Ingredients**<br>\n  - > **Restricted Cosmetic Ingredients**<br>\n  \n- Guidance-for-Industry--Cosmetic-Good-Manufacturing-Practices-PDF\n  - > **II.

According to the FDA, products that are intended for both cosmetic and drug use must be labeled in compliance with the requirements for both categories. \n\nThe Act does not require premarket approval for cosmetics, but it does prohibit the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce. Therefore, if a product is marketed as both a drug and a cosmetic, it must meet the labeling requirements applicable to both categories. This includes ensuring that the claims made on the label are truthful and not misleading, as well as complying with specific regulations for each type of product.\n\nFor example, if a moisturizer is marketed as a cosmetic for beautification purposes but also claims to treat a skin condition, it may be subject to regulation as a drug. In such cases, the labeling must reflect both the cosmetic and drug claims appropriately.\n\n### References\n\n- Guidance-for-Industry---Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-Products-and-their-Regulation-by-the-Food-and-Drug-Administration-(PDF)\n  \n  > \"The Act does not require premarket approval for cosmetics, but it does prohibit the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce.
