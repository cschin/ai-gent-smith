This guidance is intended to assist in identifying standards and issues that can affect the quality of cosmetic products. It is important to note that these guidances do not create legally enforceable responsibilities but rather describe the FDA's current thinking on a topic. \n\nThe guidance has been revised to align with international standards, specifically the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for cosmetic GMPs (ISO 22716:2007).

Introduction**<br><br>This document provides guidance to industry and other stakeholders (e.g., consumer interest \ngroups, academia, other regulatory groups) on FDA’s current thinking concerning what \nconstitutes Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for cosmetics. It is intended to assist industry \nand other stakeholders in identifying the standards and issues that can affect the quality of \ncosmetic products. <br><br>This guidance revises the “Cosmetic Good Manufacturing (GMP) Guidelines/Inspection \nChecklist” by updating it to set forth current practice, and clarify certain topic areas based on \nrecent experience. In addition, as part of an international harmonization effort with the \nInternational Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulations (ICCR), FDA (or we) agreed to consider the \ncurrent International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for cosmetic GMPs (ISO \n22716:2007) when revising this guidance. We reviewed ISO 22716 and decided to incorporate, \nmodify, or exclude specific aspects of it into this guidance based on our experience. <br><br>FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be \nviewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. \nThe use of the word*should*in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or \nrecommended, but not required.\n\n  Explanation: This context outlines the purpose of the GMP guidance, its alignment with international standards, and its non-binding nature, which is crucial for understanding the expectations for manufacturing practices in the cosmetic industry."

Here is a detailed explanation of the main components based on the FDA's guidance:\n\nThe FDA's guidance on the safety of nanomaterials in cosmetic products involves several key considerations:\n\n1. **Nonbinding Recommendations**: The guidance represents the FDA's current thinking and does not confer any rights or bind the FDA or the public. Alternative approaches may be used if they meet the applicable requirements.\n\n2. **Regulatory Definitions**: The FDA has not established specific regulatory definitions for terms like \"nanotechnology,\" \"nanomaterial,\" or \"nanoscale.\" However, the guidance issued in June 2014 outlines considerations for determining whether a product involves nanotechnology. This includes evaluating if a material or product is engineered to have dimensions in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm) or exhibits properties due to its dimensions, even if these are up to one micrometer (1,000 nm).\n\n3. **Product Attributes and Examination**: The application of nanotechnology can result in unique product attributes that differ from conventional products, necessitating particular examination. The FDA does not automatically consider products with nanomaterials as safe or harmful but evaluates them on a case-by-case basis.\n\n4. **Safety Substantiation**: The guidance suggests relying on existing toxicological data for individual ingredients and similar product formulations, alongside performing additional tests as necessary. Even if satisfactory data exist for each ingredient, further testing of the complete formulation is required to ensure the finished product's safety.\n\nThese components collectively guide the evaluation and safety assessment of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials.\n\n### References\n\n- Nano-Cosmetics-Guidance-to-OMB-PDF\n  - > **Contains Nonbinding Recommendations**  \n    **Guidance for Industry**  \n    **Safety of Nanomaterials in Cosmetic Products**  \n    This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA’s) current thinking on this topic.

You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n    \n    This context explains that the guidance is nonbinding and allows for alternative approaches.\n  \n  - > FDA has not established regulatory definitions of “nanotechnology,” “nanomaterial,” “nanoscale,” or other related terms.

Here is the information you need:\n\nThe FDA provides guidance for the safety assessment of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials. This guidance recommends that manufacturers and stakeholders consider the unique properties of nanomaterials, which can differ from larger-scale particles of the same chemical composition. These differences in properties may raise questions about the product's safety for its intended use. Therefore, the FDA suggests evaluating data needs and testing methods to address these unique properties and functions. Safety assessments should include a thorough characterization of the nanomaterial, considering its physical and chemical properties and potential impurities. Additionally, toxicology and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion considerations should be taken into account, informed by the routes of exposure and uptake.\n\n### References\n\n- Nano-Cosmetics-Guidance-to-OMB-PDF\n  - > In summary, nanomaterials can have chemical, physical, and biological properties that differ from those of larger scale particles with the same chemical composition, and the use of nanomaterials in cosmetic products may raise questions about the safety of the product for its intended use.

However, it's important to note that the FDA does not have specific regulations defining \"hypoallergenic\" nor does it require manufacturers to substantiate these claims. As a result, the term can be used by manufacturers without any specific standard or testing to validate the claim. \n\n### References\n\n- Guidance-for-Indiustry--Cosmetic-Good-Manufacturing-Practices-PDF\n\n  - > **II.

Specifically, the product must meet the labeling requirements for drugs, which include the necessity for a \"Drug Facts\" label, as well as the cosmetic labeling requirements to ensure that the product is not misbranded. This means that the labeling must clearly indicate the intended uses of the product as both a drug and a cosmetic, and must not make any misleading claims. Additionally, if a product is intended for use as both a drug and a cosmetic, it should be clearly identified as such on the label to ensure compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n### References\n\n- Guidance-for-Industry---Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-Products-and-their-Regulation-by-the-Food-and-Drug-Administration-(PDF)\n  \n  - > under the Act. For example, if a CAM practice involves massage with a moisturizer, the moisturizer could be a “cosmetic” to the extent that it is “rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on” the body for beautification or appearance-altering purposes. However, if the moisturizer’s intended use is also for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body, then it may also be subject to regulation as a drug. Other examples of drug/cosmetic combinations are deodorants that are also antiperspirants, moisturizers and makeup marketed with sun-protection claims, and shampoos that also treat dandruff. The Act does not require premarket approval for cosmetics, but it does prohibit the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce. Anyone intending to market CAM products that might be subject to regulation as cosmetics should familiarize himself/herself with the safety and labeling requirements for these products in the Act and our regulations. The Act and our cosmetic regulations can be found at our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws.\n\n    This context explains that products meeting the definition of both a drug and a cosmetic must adhere to the regulations for both categories, which includes proper labeling to avoid being considered misbranded."
