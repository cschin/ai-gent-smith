Below is an answer based on the relevant FDA cosmetic guidance on good manufacturing practices (GMP).\n\n**Key Recommendations for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in the Cosmetic Industry**\n\nThe FDA’s \"Guidance For Industry: Cosmetic Good Manufacturing Practices\" outlines the FDA’s current thinking to help cosmetic manufacturers minimize the risks of producing adulterated or misbranded products. Although the guidance does not establish legally enforceable requirements, it offers recommendations intended to ensure that cosmetics are consistently manufactured to an appropriate quality for their intended use. Some of the key recommendations include:\n\n1. **Robust Quality Assurance and Process Controls**  \n   Manufacturers are encouraged to develop and maintain an effective quality assurance system that covers both manufacturing and quality control procedures. This involves establishing standardized processes and monitoring systems to ensure that operations consistently meet quality standards.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Documentation**  \n   Effective documentation is a cornerstone of GMP. The guidance recommends that companies maintain thorough records and supporting references for all manufacturing activities. This documentation helps in tracking process consistency, testing outcomes, and any deviations, ensuring that operations can be reviewed and audited systematically.\n\n3. **Regular Self-Inspections and Internal Audits**  \n   The guidance advises manufacturers to conduct systematic self-inspections and audits. Internal audits by competent personnel should verify that all aspects of manufacturing and quality control are implemented effectively and align with the planned arrangements. This proactive review helps identify areas of risk and opportunities for improvement.\n\n4. **Adherence to Established Standards**  \n   As part of its alignment with international practices, the FDA guidance acknowledges ISO 22716:2007. Manufacturers are advised to incorporate elements from recognized international standards (with modifications or exclusions as appropriate) to ensure that their practices meet global expectations for cosmetic GMP.\n\n5. **Preventative Measures Against External Risks**  \n   To further protect product quality, the guidance recommends implementing measures to mitigate risks related to tampering, malicious activities, or other criminal actions. These measures are intended to prevent potential contaminants or security breaches that could adversely impact cosmetic quality.\n\n6. **Training and Clear Assignment of Responsibilities**  \n   Ensuring that all personnel are properly trained in GMP fundamentals and that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined is critical. This helps in maintaining a consistent application of quality procedures and enhances overall operational reliability.\n\nBy following these recommendations, cosmetic manufacturers can better safeguard against manufacturing inconsistencies, product adulteration, or misbranding, and be proactive in ensuring high product quality.\n\n---\n\n**References Used:**\n\n- DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance-for-Indiustry--Cosmetic-Good-Manufacturing-Practices-PDF\n\n---\n\n**Relevant Excerpts from the Reference:**\n\n\"Guidance For Industry Cosmetic Good Manufacturing Practices  \n...  \nIii. Discussion A. Overview  \nThe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) prohibits the introduction, or delivery for introduction, into interstate commerce of cosmetics that are adulterated or misbranded (Section 301 of the FD&C Act). If you manufacture cosmetics, you can reduce the risk of adulterating or misbranding cosmetics by following the GMP recommendations in this guidance. By following these recommendations, you can effectively conduct a self-inspection to rate your operations. Tampering and other malicious, criminal, or terrorist activity present additional risks that can also have a direct impact on your products' quality.  \n\nB.

      "content": "Hello! I’m happy to help with your question regarding FDA’s definition of “insanitary conditions” in the preparation, packing, and holding of tattoo inks.\n\nBased on the available FDA cosmetic guidance documents, there isn’t a separate or explicit definition issued specifically for tattoo inks. In general, FDA considers a cosmetic to be adulterated if it is prepared, packed, or held under conditions that are unsanitary enough to risk contamination. Although tattoo inks may be used in a manner similar to cosmetics, the FDA applies the same general expectations—that is, manufacturers must maintain sanitary conditions to avoid contamination by microorganisms, filth, or other deleterious substances.\n\nIn practice, this means that tattoo ink manufacturers are expected to follow good manufacturing practices (GMP) and sanitary guidelines to ensure that all processes (preparation, packing, and holding) prevent potential contamination. While the guidance documents we have do not provide a discussion on tattoo inks per se or offer a tailored definition for “insanitary conditions” in that context, the general concept is that any environment or process that could introduce contaminants (due to poor hygiene practices, improper cleaning, or unsanitary equipment) would be considered in violation of the general sanitary expectations for cosmetic products.\n\nIf you are preparing tattoo inks for commercial distribution, it is advisable to adhere to the standard requirements for cosmetic manufacturing and to regularly review the FDA’s guidance on facility registration and product listing, as well as any GMP recommendations. Following these standards helps ensure that your operations do not fall under the category of having “insanitary conditions,” thereby reducing the risk of your products being deemed adulterated under the FD&C Act.\n\nBelow is a list of the most relevant reference documents along with the exact copies of the relevant context excerpts:\n\n------------------------------\nReference List:\n1. DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n2. DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance-for-Industry---Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-Products-and-their-Regulation-by-the-Food-and-Drug-Administration-(PDF)\n\n------------------------------\nExact Copies of Relevant Reference Context:\n\nFrom DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24:\n\"the facility registration number of each facility where the cosmetic product is manufactured or processed;\n...\nthe name and contact number of the responsible person and the name for the cosmetic product, as such name appears on the label;\n... a list of ingredients in the cosmetic product, including any fragrances, flavors, or colors, with each ingredient identified by the name, as required under section 701.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations)...\"\n\nFrom DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance-for-Industry---Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-Products-and-their-Regulation-by-the-Food-and-Drug-Administration-(PDF):\n\"cosmetic\" to mean \"(1) articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance... However, if the moisturizer's intended use is also for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease... then it may also be subject to regulation as a drug.\"\n\n------------------------------\n\nAs these excerpts do not specifically address tattoo inks or provide a specialized definition of “insanitary conditions” for them, the general principle is that any deviation from recommended sanitary practices that may lead to contamination would likely be viewed as creating insanitary conditions.\n\nI hope this helps clarify your question.

In FDA guidance for cosmetic manufacturing, the agency highlights the need to minimize the risk of microbial contamination by requiring manufacturers to implement robust controls. Specifically, manufacturers are expected to establish and adhere to written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that include:\n\n• Routine cleaning and sanitization of equipment and systems to avoid the build‐up of biofilm and other microbial contaminants  \n• In‐process controls and precautions that help prevent contamination with microorganisms, chemicals, filth, or other extraneous materials  \n• Environmental sampling and monitoring in manufacturing facilities as part of broader quality control measures\n\nEven though the FDA does not perform product premarket approval for cosmetics such as tattoo inks, it does monitor adverse events and can take regulatory or enforcement actions if products are found to be adulterated (for example, contaminated by microbes). This regulatory approach encourages manufacturers to maintain rigorous sanitation standards to safeguard public health.\n\nBelow are the relevant references that provide further detail on these requirements:\n\nReferences:\n• Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24  \n• Guidance-for-Industry--Cosmetic-Good-Manufacturing-Practices-PDF  \n\nRelevant excerpts:\n\nFrom Guidance-for-Industry--Cosmetic-Good-Manufacturing-Practices-PDF:\n\"risks of contamination (This system should be routinely cleaned and sanitized according to an appropriate SOP that ensures no biofilm build-up.)\"\n\nFrom Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24:\n\"[…] additional contact information for individuals associated with the registration.\"\n\nI hope this information helps clarify how FDA addresses microbial contamination risks in products like tattoo inks.

Based on the FDA’s existing guidance, here are the key points:\n\n1. The FDA encourages manufacturers and other stakeholders to assess the potential safety issues that may arise from incorporating nanomaterials into cosmetic products. These materials have unique chemical, physical, and biological properties that may differ from those of larger particles with the same composition.\n\n2. Manufacturers should evaluate and validate appropriate test methods to determine both short‐term and long‐term toxicity. In particular, the guidance highlights that unique factors—such as cytotoxicity, aggregation, or precipitation of insoluble ingredients—should be thoroughly examined. This is important because such altered properties could affect the performance, quality, and safety of the cosmetic product.\n\n3. Although the guidance does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities, it recommends that sponsors engage in proactive discussions with the FDA if there are questions about the safety testing and data needed, especially when novel properties are introduced by nanomaterials. This can include meetings to discuss customized testing protocols and necessary data to substantiate the product’s safety.\n\n4. The overall approach is to develop a comprehensive safety assessment framework that considers the unique characteristics imparted by the nanoscale dimensions or enhanced properties of nanomaterials. Manufacturers are advised to address any data needs and testing methods that may be necessary given the altered behavior of these ingredients versus their conventional forms.\n\nIn summary, the FDA’s recommendations for ensuring the safety of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials are to:\n- Evaluate the unique properties and potential risks associated with nanomaterials.\n- Develop and validate testing methods (with attention to issues like cytotoxicity and aggregation) suitable for assessing these risks.\n- Engage with the FDA for guidance and discussion to ensure that the safety data and testing strategies are adequate.\n\nBelow is the list of references used, along with the exact copy of the relevant context:\n\n---\n**References:**\n\n• DOCUMET TITLE: Nano-Cosmetics-Guidance-to-OMB-PDF\n\n---\n\n**Relevant Context:**\n\n\"This document provides guidance to industry and other stakeholders (e.g., academia, other regulatory groups) on FDA's current thinking on the safety assessment of nanomaterials in cosmetic products.

This guidance also provides contact information for manufacturers and sponsors who wish to discuss safety considerations regarding the use of specific nanomaterials in cosmetic products with FDA. This guidance is not applicable to other products regulated by FDA, including over-the-counter and prescription drugs and medical devices. FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.

I'm happy to help with your question about how the FDA suggests handling complaints, adverse events, and recalls for cosmetic products.\n\nAt this time, the FDA’s published guidance documents for cosmetic product facility registration and listing (such as those referenced below) do not provide a detailed, standalone procedure specifically for managing consumer complaints, adverse events, and recalls for cosmetics. Rather, the FDA’s current thinking is reflected in general recommendations for manufacturers to have internal systems and written protocols that enable them to:\n\n• Promptly receive and document consumer complaints and any reports of adverse events.  \n• Periodically evaluate such reports as part of their quality assurance and good manufacturing practices (GMPs) systems.  \n• Investigate and, if necessary, take corrective actions—including the voluntary recall of products when a safety risk is identified.  \n\nIn practice, while the requirement to register and list cosmetic products under section 607 of the FD&C Act (as updated by the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022) focuses on ensuring manufacturers provide complete product and facility information (including contacts for responsible individuals), it does not prescribe detailed operational procedures for complaint handling or recalls. Instead, the FDA expects cosmetic manufacturers to integrate these issues into their overall quality control and risk management processes. Moreover, if a complaint or adverse event raises a safety concern, the FDA strongly encourages manufacturers to communicate proactively with the agency and, if needed, initiate a voluntary recall to protect public health.\n\nIn summary, while the FDA’s guidance for cosmetic facility registration and listing does not outline a specific “complaints/adverse events/recalls” protocol, manufacturers are advised to maintain robust internal procedures as part of their GMPs and quality assurance systems to address these matters effectively.\n\nBelow are the references that support this discussion:\n\n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24  \n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance-CompliancePolicyCosmeticRegistrationListing-11032023\n\nHere is the exact copy of the relevant reference context from one of the documents:\n\n────────────────────────────\nDOCUMET TITLE: Guidance-CompliancePolicyCosmeticRegistrationListing-11032023\n\nCONTEXT:\n“the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.”\n────────────────────────────\n\nThis excerpt underscores that much of the FDA’s guidance, including aspects related to product oversight, is designed to offer recommendations rather than mandates. Therefore, while manufacturers are expected to have systems in place to handle complaints, adverse events, and recalls as part of their overall compliance and quality assurance practices, the FDA’s guidance does not impose a detailed, one-size-fits-all procedure.\n\nI’m here and ready to answer any further questions you may have—please feel free to ask!"

There is no fee charged for submitting a cosmetic facility registration or product listing under section 607 of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollowing these steps will ensure that your cosmetic company complies with the FDA requirements related to facility registration and product listing.

These practices are drawn directly from FDA guidance and include several key steps:\n\n1. • Determine that your facility is subject to registration requirements. (For example, if you manufacture or process cosmetic products, you must register; note that storage‐only facilities are exempt.)\n\n2. • Gather and verify all the required facility information before initiating submission. This includes the facility address, DUNS Number, and, if applicable, the parent company name. It is also important to designate a responsible person with the appropriate contact information.\n\n3. • Prepare detailed information that you will need for cosmetic product listing. This includes:\n  – The cosmetic product name as it appears on the label,\n  – The applicable product category (using the FDA’s Appendix A codes; if your product does not fit neatly into a category, select the one that most closely matches or use the “other” category),\n  – A complete list of ingredients (with each ingredient identified as required under section 701.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, or by its common or usual name), and\n  – Any optional information that might assist in the review of your submission (such as an image of the product label or a webpage link).\n\n4. • Make use of the FDA’s electronic submission process to register your facility and list your products. This streamlined process is the same one the FDA uses for drug establishment and listing information, allowing you to combine related submissions when applicable.\n\n5. • Ensure the information submitted is complete and accurate, and be prepared to attest to its veracity as required by the FDA. This will avoid potential follow-up questions or the need for resubmission.\n\n6. • Finally, plan for ongoing maintenance of your submissions (e.g., biennial renewals, amended, or abbreviated renewals) to remain compliant with the FDA's requirements.\n\nEach of these best practices ensures that your facility registration for cosmetic manufacturing complies with the FDA’s requirements and supports a clear, accurate, and streamlined submission process.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n\n**Exact Relevant Snippets:**\n\n\"Cosmetic product facility registration and product listing are available using the same electronic submission process available to register an establishment and list a drug with FDA.

      "content": "Hello! I'm ready to help with your question about FDA classifications. Here's the answer:\n\nAccording to the FDA, a product that is marketed as a cosmetic becomes considered a drug when its intended use goes beyond cleaning, beautifying, or altering appearance. More specifically, if the product is intended:\n\n• for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or  \n• to affect the structure or any function of the body,  \n\nthen it meets the definition of a drug rather than—or in addition to—a cosmetic. This means that even if a product is applied to the body for beautification purposes, if it is also promoted with claims that imply therapeutic benefits or effects on the structure/functions of the body, the FDA may classify it as a drug. This distinction is important, as drugs are subject to different regulatory requirements than cosmetics.\n\nBelow are the relevant references and the exact excerpts from the FDA guidance documents:\n\nReferences:\n• DOCUMET TITLE: 2021-16 Draft 702(b) Guidance - Clean 01-11-2022 508 compliant  \n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n\nRelevant Excerpts:\n\nFrom DOCUMET TITLE: 2021-16 Draft 702(b) Guidance - Clean 01-11-2022 508 compliant:\n\"States Pharmacopoeia, official Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals;\"\n  \nFrom the same document defining cosmetics:\n\"Cosmetic means '(1) articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance...';\"\n\nThese excerpts illustrate that when a product is intended for therapeutic uses (diagnosis, cure, treatment, etc.) or to affect the structure or function of the body, it is deemed a drug by the FDA—even if it might otherwise be used for cosmetic purposes.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any further questions or need additional details!"

It should clearly indicate the type or kind of cosmetic product, helping consumers understand its intended use.  \n   • The brand name, which may be a distinctive and trademarked identifier, might be used in conjunction with this statement.\n\n2. **Ingredient Declaration:**  \n   • Include a complete and accurate list of ingredients. Every ingredient—including any fragrances, flavors, or colors—should be identified by its proper name (or common or usual name as required).\n\n3. **Responsible Party Information:**  \n   • The label must display the name and contact number of the responsible person in accordance with FDA requirements.  \n   • For products marketed in the United States, ensure that a domestic address, domestic phone number, or electronic contact information (such as a website) is provided so that consumers can report adverse events.\n\n4. **Additional Information:**  \n   • Consider including optional information that helps the consumer or facilitates regulatory compliance, such as the product’s webpage link or an indication if the product is intended for professional use only.  \n   • Ensure that any claims on the label do not inadvertently imply that the cosmetic product has therapeutic properties, as this could lead to the product being classified as a drug.\n\nBelow are the reference contexts used to prepare this answer:\n\n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n\n  Exact excerpt:  \n  \"the name and contact number of the responsible person and the name for the cosmetic product, as such name appears on the label;  \n  …  \n  a list of ingredients in the cosmetic product, including any fragrances, flavors, or colors, with each ingredient identified by the name, as required under section 701.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), or by the common or usual name of the ingredient;  \n  …  \n  Q4.

      "content": "Hello! I'm happy to help with your questions about FDA guidance and cosmetics. Your inquiry about what cosmetic products will exist in 50 years is an interesting and forward-looking question. However, it is important to note that the FDA’s current guidance documents—such as those for cosmetic registration and listing—focus on the regulation and oversight of products available today. The guidance documents provide detailed classifications and requirements for a wide range of cosmetics, including (for example) children’s eye makeup, perfumes, powders, hair care products (like shampoos and conditioners), and makeup preparations (like foundations, lipsticks, and blushers). These documents help ensure that products marketed for cosmetic use meet safety and labeling standards.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from the current guidance that lists various categories of cosmetic products:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\"Other children's eye makeup. (05) \n (a) Colognes and toilet waters. (b) Perfumes. (c) Powders (dusting and talcum) (excluding aftershave talc). (d) Other fragrance preparations. (06) \n (a) Hair conditioners.\n(b) Hair sprays (aerosol fixatives). (c) Hair straighteners. (d) Permanent waves. (e) Rinses (non-coloring). (f) Shampoos (non-coloring).\n(g) Tonics, dressings, and other hair grooming aids. (h) Wave sets. (i) Other hair preparations.\n(07) \n (a) Hair dyes and colors (all types requiring caution statement and patch test). (b) Hair tints. (c) Hair rinses (coloring).\n(d) Hair shampoos (coloring).\n(e) Hair color sprays (aerosol). (f) Hair lighteners with color. (g) Hair bleaches. (h) Eyelash and eyebrow dyes. (i) Other hair coloring preparations.\n(08) Makeup preparations (not eye)(other \n (a) Blushers and rouges (all types). (b) Face powders. (c) Foundations.\n(d) Leg and body paints.\n(e) Lipsticks and lip glosses. (f) Makeup bases.\n(g) Makeup fixatives.

(d) Children's foundations. (e) Children's lipsticks and lip glosses. (f) Children's color hairsprays. (g) Other children's makeup.\"\n──────────────────────────────\n\nPredicting exactly what cosmetic products will exist in 50 years would be highly speculative. Innovation in cosmetics may evolve significantly as new technologies and materials emerge. Future products might incorporate advanced ingredients derived from biotechnology, smart formulations that interact with digital devices or personalized diagnostics, and eco-friendly or sustainable innovations that respond to both consumer demands and environmental considerations. Yet, regardless of future product innovations, any cosmetic product marketed in the United States will still need to adhere to the principles of safety, accurate labeling, and regulatory compliance as established by the FDA.\n\nIf you’d like more specific details about current regulatory categories or how the FDA approaches cosmetic manufacturing and registration, please feel free to ask. I'm here and ready for your next question!  \n\n──────────────────────────────  \nReferences:  \n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24  \n──────────────────────────────  \n\nExact relevant text from the reference:  \n\"Other children's eye makeup.

      "content": "Hello! Thank you for your question about animal testing requirements for cosmetics.\n\nBased on FDA guidance and current regulations, the FDA does not require that cosmetics be tested on animals before they are marketed. Instead, it is the manufacturer's responsibility to ensure that their cosmetic products are safe for consumer use. Companies may use alternative testing methods—including in vitro tests, computer modeling, or human use studies—to substantiate safety, as long as the methods provide appropriate assurance of safety.\n\nWhile the FDA's guidance covers various aspects of cosmetic product registration, ingredient listing, and labeling requirements (for example, see the details in the \"Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\" document), none of these documents specify a mandatory requirement for animal testing. The emphasis is on the accuracy and compliance of information provided, ensuring that products meet safety standards without prescribing a specific testing method.\n\nBelow is the reference context that supports this framework (note that animal testing is not mentioned as a requirement):\n\nReferences:\n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24\n\nExact relevant excerpt from the reference:\n\"the product listing number, if any previously assigned; and\ntype of submission (initial, update to content (annual), abbreviated renewal).\nUnder section 607(c)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, a single listing submission for a cosmetic product may include multiple cosmetic products with identical formulations, or formulations that differ only with respect to colors, fragrances or flavors, or quantity of contents.\"\n\nThis excerpt outlines the information required for cosmetic product listings and safety substantiation, but does not include any mandate for animal testing.\n\nI’m here and ready to help with any further questions you have about FDA cosmetic regulations or any other related topics.

      "content": "Welcome! I'm ready to help with your FDA cosmetics questions.\n\nRegarding your question, “What are ‘hypoallergenic’ cosmetics?” here’s what you need to know:\n\n• The term “hypoallergenic” is commonly used in the cosmetics industry as a marketing descriptor to indicate that a product is formulated to have a lower potential for causing allergic reactions.  \n• The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not have an official definition or specific regulatory criteria for the use of the term “hypoallergenic.” In other words, the FDA does not require manufacturers to substantiate this claim through any particular test or standard before marketing a cosmetic product under this label.  \n• Because the FDA does not review or approve these claims prior to the product being marketed, any representations that a cosmetic is “hypoallergenic” are the responsibility of the manufacturer to ensure are truthful and supported by appropriate evidence.\n\nThe current FDA guidance documents for cosmetic registration and listing, such as the “Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24,” do not specifically address the term “hypoallergenic.” These documents focus on requirements such as product listing, the identity of ingredients, and safety assurances, leaving descriptive claims like “hypoallergenic” to the discretion of the manufacturer.\n\nBelow is the list of references and the relevant context from the documents:\n\nReferences:  \n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24  \n• DOCUMET TITLE: 2021-16 Draft 702(b) Guidance - Clean 01-11-2022 508 compliant\n\nRelevant context from DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24:\n--------------------------------------------------  \n\"Cosmetic means '(1) articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) articles intended for use as a component of any such articles; except that such term shall not include soap' (section 201(i)).\"  \n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the documents detail cosmetic definitions and product registration requirements, they do not provide a definition for or specific guidance regarding “hypoallergenic” claims. Thus, it remains a voluntary marketing term without a formal FDA classification.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any more questions you might have!"

I'm here to help with your FDA-related questions.\n\nRegarding your question:\n\nDoes the FDA pre-approve cosmetic product labeling?\n\nNo, the FDA does not pre-approve cosmetic product labeling. Under the FD&C Act, cosmetic manufacturers are responsible for ensuring that their product labeling is truthful, not misleading, and complies with applicable regulatory requirements. Unlike drugs or certain medical devices, cosmetics aren’t subject to pre-market review or approval by the FDA.

Please feel free to ask any new question related to FDA regulations.\n\nRegarding your current question on how products should be labeled if they are both drugs and cosmetics:\n\nWhen a product is marketed as both a drug and a cosmetic—often seen in items like deodorants that function as antiperspirants, moisturizers or makeup with sun-protection claims, or shampoos that treat dandruff—it must adhere to the labeling requirements for both categories. Specifically:\n\n• It must include all the mandatory drug labeling requirements. This generally means that if the product is intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or if it affects the structure or any function of the body in a way that categorizes it as a drug, the label must contain proper directions for use, warnings, and any other drug-specific information subject to the FDA’s drug regulations.\n\n• In addition, the product label must comply with cosmetic labeling requirements. This includes providing the proper identity of the product, an ingredient list with ingredients named according to FDA regulations, and any other information necessary to ensure that the product’s claims (e.g., “beautifying,” “cleansing,” or “altering appearance”) are both truthful and not misleading.\n\nIn practice, manufacturers must ensure that the label meets the most restrictive aspects of both regulatory frameworks. It is important for marketing materials not to create confusion over the product’s dual nature—consumers should be able to clearly see which claims pertain to the drug function and which relate to the cosmetic aspect.\n\nBelow are reference citations with the exact wording from the context that relates to dual-use products:\n\nReferences:\n• DOCUMET TITLE: Guidance-for-Industry---Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-Products-and-their-Regulation-by-the-Food-and-Drug-Administration-(PDF)\n\nExact Copy of Relevant Reference Context:\n\"Other examples of drug/cosmetic combinations are deodorants that are also antiperspirants, moisturizers and makeup marketed with sun-protection claims, and shampoos that also treat dandruff. However, if the moisturizer's intended use is also for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body, then it may also be subject to regulation as a drug.\"\n\nFeel free to ask another question or request further clarification!"

Instead, any \"organic\" claim on cosmetics must adhere to the general FDA requirements for labeling, meaning the claims must be truthful, substantiated, and not misleading.
