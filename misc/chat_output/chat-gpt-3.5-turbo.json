The term \"hypoallergenic\" implies that the product is less likely to cause an allergic reaction compared to regular cosmetics. However, it is essential to note that the FDA does not have a definition or regulation for the term \"hypoallergenic\" concerning cosmetics. Manufacturers are responsible for substantiating the hypoallergenic claims of their products and ensuring their safety through appropriate testing methods.\n\nReferences:\n- Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24"

      "content": "Products that are both drugs and cosmetics should follow specific labeling requirements. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), if a product is intended for use as both a drug and a cosmetic, it is considered a combination product. In such cases, the product must comply with the regulations for both drugs and cosmetics.\n\nThe FDA requires that the labeling of combination products clearly indicate the presence of both cosmetic and drug components. The labeling should accurately reflect the intended use of the product, whether it is for cosmetic purposes like beautification or appearance-altering, or for therapeutic purposes such as treatment, mitigation, or prevention of disease. Manufacturers must ensure that the labeling is not false or misleading and does not violate any FDA regulations for either drugs or cosmetics.\n\nIn addition, if a facility manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are also drugs, specific requirements apply regarding facility registration and product listing. Manufacturers must accurately list the categories of products manufactured at the facility, including those that are both cosmetics and drugs. However, facilities that only manufacture drugs are not subject to specific regulations for cosmetic product facility registration and listing unless they also produce cosmetic products that are not drugs.\n\nTherefore, it is essential for manufacturers of products that are both drugs and cosmetics to carefully label their products to reflect their dual nature, comply with all FDA regulations for both categories, and accurately register and list their facilities and products accordingly.\n\nReferences:\n- Guidance - Cosmetics - Registration Listing-12-02-24"
