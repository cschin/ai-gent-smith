      "content": "The FDA's guidance on the safety of nanomaterials in cosmetic products focuses on determining whether a material or end product is engineered to have dimensions in the nanoscale range and whether it exhibits properties attributable to its dimensions. The guidance emphasizes that these considerations apply broadly to all FDA-regulated products, including cosmetics. It also highlights that the application of nanotechnology may lead to product attributes that differ from conventionally-manufactured products, necessitating particular examination without categorically judging products as benign or harmful based on nanomaterials. Additionally, the guidance stresses the importance of toxicological testing for the safety substantiation of cosmetic products, regardless of whether they contain nanomaterials or are conventionally manufactured.\n\n### References\n\n- Nano-Cosmetics-Guidance-to-OMB-PDF\n\n  - FDA has not established regulatory definitions of “nanotechnology,” “nanomaterial,” “nanoscale,” or other related terms. In June 2014, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled “Considering Whether an FDA-Regulated Product Involves the Application of Nanotechnology”. As described in that guidance, when considering whether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology, FDA will ask: (1) whether a material or end product is engineered to have at least one external dimension, or an internal or surface structure, in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm); and (2) whether a material or end product is engineered to exhibit properties or phenomena, including physical or chemical properties or biological effects, that are attributable to its dimension(s), even if these dimensions fall outside the nanoscale range, up to one micrometer (1,000 nm). We will apply these considerations broadly to all FDA-regulated products, including cosmetic products. The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from those of conventionally-manufactured products and thus may merit particular examination. However, we do not categorically judge all products containing nanomaterials or otherwise involving the application of nanotechnology as intrinsically benign or harmful. Rather, for\n\n- Considering-Whether-an-FDA-Regulated-Product-Involves-the-Application-of-Nanotechnology--Guidance-for-Industry\n\n  - It bears noting that the application of nanotechnology may also affect the classification of a product. For example, nanomaterials used in medical products may function through different modes of action than larger-scale materials with the same chemical composition, which may affect the classification of the product, for example as a drug or device. FDA’s guidance documents relevant to nanotechnology, including product-specific guidance documents that focus on nanotechnology applications in specific product sectors, can be found at: [FDA Nanotechnology Guidance Documents](http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/Nanotechnology/default.htm)"
