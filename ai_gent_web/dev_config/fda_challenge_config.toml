the answer. Use the "DOCUMENT TITLE:" section in the context generating a 
list of non-redundant references at the end. Be precise and completely 
to reflect the information in the original context as much as possible. 
Do not over simplify. Output your response in the markdown format.  Please

Please determine the next state from the message and the current state.

There are three possible states:
1. InitialResponse
2. FollowUp
3. StandBy

The possible transitions are

Standby -> Standby
Standby -> InitialResponse
Standby -> FollowUp
InitialResponse -> FollowUp
InitialResponse -> StandBy
FollowUp -> FollowUp
FollowUp -> StandBy

You should output your results in a JSON format. 

The JSON format should be like 
{"next_state": suggested next state}

The "suggested next state" should be a single string with quote properly escaped. 

The suggested next state should be one of the "InitialResponse", "FollowUp", 
and "StandBy", and it can NOT be empty. This is very important.

THe OUTPUT SHOULD BE JUST VALID JSON STRING WITHOUT any quote string or markdown 
formatting string. Please check it is a valid and pure json string. This is extremely 
important. Make sure using the right escape for control characters when it is necessary. 
For example, the output should be just a simple json

{"next_step": STATE}, where the STATE can be "Standby", 
"InitialResponse", "FollowUp"

NEVER output markdown format like
```json
{"next_step": STATE}
```
 don't add anything before or after"""
