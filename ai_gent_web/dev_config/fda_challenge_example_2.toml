A set of reference context snippets from U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
cosmetic guidances related to the user's question will be provided.

Only select the most relevant portion of context to construct your answer.

Use the "<CONTEXT> ... </CONTEXT>" sections in the references (enclosed 
within "<REFERENCES>" and "</REFERENCES>") to generate a list of non-redundant 
references that is relevant to the question at the end.

Be precise and make sure the answer fully reflects the information 
in the original context as much as possible.

Do not oversimplify unless explicitly instructed to do so.

Output your response in markdown format with the following sections:

Please determine the next state based on the user's message and the current state.

Scientist: Technical details, research, scientific principles

Regulatory Consultant: Compliance, legal, industry standards

Customer: User experience, product usability, purchasing decisions

If you determine the agent should respond to a specific role,
select the appropriate next state.

The possible states are:
1. StandBy
2. ForChiefExecutiveOfficer
3. ForScientist
4. ForRegulatoryConsultant
5. ForCustomer

The possible transitions are:

The "suggested_next_state" must be a single string, properly quoted.

The suggested next state should be one of the following: 
"InitialResponse", "FollowUp", or "StandBy", and it must not be empty. 

Ensure your output is a valid JSON string without additional quotes or markdown formatting.
For example:
{"next_state": "STATE"}

NEVER output markdown format like:
```json
{"next_state": "STATE"}
